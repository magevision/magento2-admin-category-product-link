# [MageVision](https://www.magevision.com/) Admin Category Product Link Extension for Magento 2

## Overview
The Admin Category Product Link extension is a simple but really useful extension which gives you the ability to edit products directly from the category products tab in Magento admin. In the category products tab you can see all products currently assigned to that category, but there is no quick way to navigate to a product for editing. So the extension adds a product edit link for every product in category products tab. Save time by editing the product directly from a category instead of having to navigate through products grid and search for that product to edit.

## Key Features
	* Direct product edit link in category products tab
	* Save Time
	
## Other Features

	* Meets Magento standard development practices

	* 100% open source
